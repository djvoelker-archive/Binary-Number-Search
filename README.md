# Binary-Search-Guessing-Game

Run main.py for the game.

The size of the list is random but between the minimum and maximum list size specified.

The numbers generated in the list are between the lower and upper bound of values specified,
but will not necessarily include those values.

This is my first Python project. It is made using the tkinter and random libraries in Python.
This project is not perfect as it is my first one. For example, I used too many global variables.
